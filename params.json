{"name":"puppet: fail_unconfigured","tagline":"Puppet function to simplify failure","body":"fail_unconfigured\r\n=================\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThe 'fail_unconfigured' function was written to simplify a common default case: fail and log a few facts that are often used in case expressions.\r\n\r\n    class foo::params {\r\n        case $operatingsystem {\r\n            \"knownos\": { ... }\r\n            default: {\r\n                fail(\"error=not_configured node=$hostname module=foo operatingsystem=$operatingsystem\")\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWith this function, we are able to simplify to this:\r\n\r\n    class foo::params {\r\n        case $operatingsystem {\r\n            \"knownos\": { ... }\r\n            default: { fail_unconfigured() }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAuthor\r\n-------\r\nWil Cooley wcooley(at)nakedape.cc\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n    Author:: Wil Cooley (wcooley(at)nakedape.cc)\r\n    Copyright:: Copyright (c) 2013 Wil Cooley\r\n    License:: Apache License, Version 2.0\r\n\r\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n        http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n    limitations under the License.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupport\r\n-------\r\n\r\nPlease log tickets and issues at our [Github project](https://github.com/wcooley/puppet-fail_unconfigured/issues).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
